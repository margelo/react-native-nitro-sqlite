## ðŸš§ `react-native-quick-sqlite` (DEPRECATED)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `react-native-quick-sqlite` has been deprecated in favor of [`react-native-nitro-sqlite`](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-nitro-sqlite).
>

Please go to the [`react-native-nitro-sqlite`](https://github.com/margelo/react-native-nitro-sqlite) repository instead.

This is our new [Nitro module](https://nitro.margelo.com/) implementation of this library.

Nitro modules is a React Native library that let's us make the codebase more readable and easier to maintain. This way, we're able to fix bugs faster and implement new features! ðŸš€

### Future releases

From major version `9.0.0` on, this library will be shipped in the NPM package `react-native-nitro-sqlite`. New features are going to be implemented there.

We will still provide bug fixes to `react-native-quick-sqlite@8.x.x` for the coming weeks/months.
